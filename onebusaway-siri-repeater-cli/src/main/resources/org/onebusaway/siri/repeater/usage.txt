Request Examples:
  
    Requests control the connections that are made to remote SIRI data sources.
  At a minimum, it includes a url and a SIRI module type.  However, other
  options are available as well.  Here is a simple example to get you started:
 
    Url=http://host:port/path,ModuleType=VEHICLE_MONITORING
    Url=http://host:port/path,ModuleType=VEHICLE_MONITORING,VehicleRef=1234

Filter Examples:

    Filters allow you to match particular SIRI data streams and filter the data
  within when repeated to clients.  The following example has been split onto
  multiple lines for clarity, but should be specified as one string on the
  command line:
  
    Match.ModuleType=VEHICLE_MONITORING,
    Filter.Type=Elements,
    Filter.Element.VehicleActivity.MonitoredVehicleJourney.OperatorRef,
    Filter.Element.VehicleActivity.MonitoredVehicleJourney.InPanic=true
