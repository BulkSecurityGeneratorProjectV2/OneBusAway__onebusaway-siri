Release Notes

* ${currentVersion}

  * Initial entries for SIRI replay tool, which can simulate a SIRI server using a log of SIRI XML messages
    previously stored using onebusaway-siri-client.
    
  * Add better support for resource management when dealing with multiple, potentially slow endpoints.  This includes
    thread and HTTP connection pools for concurrent operations and support for connection timeout parameters for
    slow HTTP connections.
    
  * Fix a bug where a subscription was not properly cleaned up, even if the SIRI endpoint indicates that the
    subscription termination might not have been successful.
  
  * More per-connection statistics to measure connection errors, the average time needed to send a ServiceDelivery
    to a client, the average delay between when a ServiceDelivery was generated and when we actually
    send it to the client, and the average delay between when a ServiceDelivery was generated and when we actually
    receive it in the client.

* 1.0.5

  * In the SIRI command-line tool, when writing SIRI output to disk, automatically create the parent directory if it
    doesn't exist.  This will let you do cool things like create a directory using the elements of the current time or
    date automatically.  See the {{{./onebusaway-siri-client-cli.html}command-line tool documentation}} for more
    details.

  * Include support for adding {{{./apidocs/org/onebusaway/siri/core/SiriClientRequest.html}SiriClientRequest}} details to
    the {{{./apidocs/org/onebusaway/siri/core/SiriChannelInfo.html}SiriChannelInfo}} object included with service
    deliveries.  This will allow a SIRI client to determine the original request responsible for a specific service
    delivery.

  * Add methods to {{{./apidocs/org/onebusaway/siri/core/SiriLibrary.html}SiriLibrary}} for examining the expiration
    status of SIRI SX situations.

  * Support for {{{./apidocs/index.html?org/onebusaway/siri/core/services/StatusService.html}StatusService}} for
    querying diagnostic information about the current SIRI process.  See {{{./apidocs/index.html?org/onebusaway/siri/jetty/StatusServletSource.html}StatusServletSource}}
    for details on how the status information can be exposed through a simple web interface.
