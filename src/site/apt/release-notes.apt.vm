Release Notes

* ${currentVersion}

  * In the SIRI command-line tool, when writing SIRI output to disk, automatically create the parent directory if it
    doesn't exist.  This will let you do cool things like create a directory using the elements of the current time or
    date automatically.  See the {{{./onebusaway-siri-client-cli.html}command-line tool documentation}} for more
    details.

  * Include support for adding {{{./apidocs/org/onebusaway/siri/core/SiriClientRequest.html}SiriClientRequest}} details to
    the {{{./apidocs/org/onebusaway/siri/core/SiriChannelInfo.html}SiriChannelInfo}} object included with service
    deliveries.  This will allow a SIRI client to determine the original request responsible for a specific service
    delivery.

  * Add methods to {{{./apidocs/org/onebusaway/siri/core/SiriLibrary.html}SiriLibrary}} for examining the expiration
    status of SIRI SX situations.
